# Project Repository

Welcome to the collaborative project repository! Each contributor will create a folder for themselves and add their own version of the project within that folder. Please follow the steps below to add your work.

## <span style="color: #007BFF;">Instructions for Adding Your Version</span>

1. **Complete Your Version:**  
   Make sure your version of the project is finished and ready for submission before adding it to the repository.

2. **Create a Folder for Your Version:**  
   - In the directory created after your name of the repository, create a folder named after your version number (e.g., `v1.0` or `1.1`).
   - This folder will hold all files related to your version of the project.

3. **Add Your Files:**  
   - Place all the necessary files for your version of the project inside your folder. This includes code, assets, and any other files required for your version to work.
   - If applicable, include a `README.md` in your folder that explains what your version includes and any special instructions or changes you made.

4. **Commit Your Changes:**  
   - Once your files are added to your folder, commit your changes with a clear commit message describing what you've added.  
     (e.g., **"Added MyVersion - YourName"**)

5. **Push to the Repository:**  
   - Push your changes to the main branch so that everyone can access your version of the project.

6. **Notify the Team:**  
   - After pushing your version, notify the team in the communication channel (e.g., Slack, Teams) so that everyone is aware your version has been added.

## <span style="color: #28a745;">Best Practices</span>

<ul>
  <li><b>Organize Your Files:</b> Keep your folder neat and only include the files that are necessary for your version of the project. Avoid adding unnecessary files.</li>
  <li><b>Use Clear Naming Conventions:</b> Name your folder and files consistently so they are easy to identify.</li>
  <li><b>Document Your Work:</b> Include a <code>README.md</code> in your folder if you have specific instructions, or to explain the details of your version.</li>
</ul>

## <span style="color: #ffc107;">Collaboration Guidelines</span>

<ol>
  <li><b>Respect Other Contributors:</b> Do not overwrite or modify other contributors' files. Each person should only modify their own folder.</li>
  <li><b>Pull the Latest Changes:</b> Always pull the latest version of the repository before making any changes to avoid conflicts.</li>
  <li><b>Commit Often:</b> Make frequent commits to document your progress and ensure that your work can be easily recovered.</li>
</ol>

Thank you for your contributions, and let's work together to make this project a success!
